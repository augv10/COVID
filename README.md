This is the Grand Challenges Project.

iDirectory Task_01: The first task is to use ERA5 data to generate the values of the criterion on each grid point.
                    For this we need to create 2-meter Specific humidity and temperature time series for each State. 
                    Define State => Find which ERA5 grid points within State => Calclulate Specific Humidity => 
                    Store Temperature and Specific Humidity for each State from 1940 - 2023 => Save each state 
                    separatly.
